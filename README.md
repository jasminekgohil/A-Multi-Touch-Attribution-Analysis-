# A-Multi-Touch-Attribution-Analysis

This analysis examines customer touchpoints and marketing channel effectiveness for Winters over a specific time period (May 1, 2012 - June 1, 2012). Here's a breakdown of the key findings:

**Attribution Models:**
* We compared two common attribution models: Last-Touch and First-Touch.
* Last-Touch assigns credit to the final touchpoint before conversion (e.g., "BUZZ AFFILIATE").
* First-Touch assigns credit to the initial touchpoint in the customer journey (e.g., "SEARCH GOOGLE NON-BRAND").
* We also considered a Linear Attribution model, distributing credit equally across all touchpoints.

**Channel Performance:**
* The analysis highlights top converting channels under Last-Touch ("CPM," "BUZZ AFFILIATE," "CJ").
* First-Touch attribution suggests potential importance of channels like "SEARCH GOOGLE NON-BRAND" and "PRINT - MAGAZINES" for initiating customer interest.

**New vs. Returning Customers:**
* New customers convert faster (average 6.16 days) compared to returning customers (average 30.3 days).
* New customers interact with fewer touchpoints (average 5.43) before converting compared to returning customers (average 6.27).
* New customers tend to have a higher average order value ($269.65) compared to returning customers ($206.91).

**Detailed Revenue Analysis:**
A table was created to show average sales per order and total revenue by originating channel.

**Incremental Revenue Analysis:**
We calculated the estimated incremental net revenue generated by each channel, considering gross margin and different incremental sales rates for branded and non-branded search.

**Search Ad Team Recommendations:**
Based on calculations, branded search advertising appears profitable despite lower incremental sales figures, suggesting a positive return on investment (ROI).

**Linear Attribution Analysis:**
* We compared the credit share of each channel under the Linear model to First-Touch and Last-Touch models.
* The Linear model provides a more balanced view, whereas First-Touch prioritizes initial touchpoints and Last-Touch prioritizes the final touchpoint before conversion.

**Touchpoint Position Analysis:**
* We analyzed the distribution of touchpoints by position (Originator, Roster, Assist, Converter) for top channels.
* This helps understand the role each channel plays in the customer journey (e.g., initial touchpoint, influencing conversion, etc.).

**Key Takeaways:**
* Attribution models significantly impact how credit is allocated to marketing channels.
* Different customer segments (new vs. returning) exhibit distinct behaviors.
* Analyzing touchpoint positions provides insights into a channel's role in the customer journey.
